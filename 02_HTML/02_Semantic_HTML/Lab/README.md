# Exercise: Creating a Webpage about Your Favorite Character

In this exercise, you will create a simple webpage dedicated to a character you admire. The page should provide an introduction to the character, along with a few key details about them. This exercise will use basic HTML and semantic tags to create a clear, organized structure.

## Folder and File Setup

1. **Create a Folder**: Inside your `Lab` folder, create a folder named `FavoriteCharacter`.
2. **Main HTML File**: In the `FavoriteCharacter` folder, create a single HTML file named `index.html`.

## HTML Structure Requirements

Your page should be structured with the following elements:

1. **Title**: Set the title of the page to the name of your favorite character.

2. **Header**:

   - Use a `<header>` tag to display the main heading (e.g., the character’s name) at the top of the page.
   - Include a short introductory paragraph about why this character is special or interesting to you.

3. **Main Content**:

   - Use a `<main>` tag to contain the primary content about the character.
   - Inside `<main>`, include:
     - **A section for Background**: Use a `<section>` or `<div class="background">` to give a brief description of the character’s background or origin story.
     - **A section for Key Traits**: Create another `<section>` or `<div class="traits">` that describes two or three key traits or characteristics that make the character memorable.
     - **An image**: Add an image that represents the character (if possible). Use the `<img>` tag with an `alt` attribute to describe the image.

4. **Footer**:
   - At the bottom of the page, include a `<footer>` with a copyright note or a short message, such as “A tribute to [Character’s Name].”
