1. **What is an API, and how does it facilitate communication in web applications?**  
   An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In the context of web applications, APIs provide endpoints through which clients (e.g., mobile apps, browsers) can access and manipulate data stored on servers. This allows applications to remain modular, so front-end interfaces can interact with back-end services in a standardized way.

2. **What is a RESTful API, and why is it widely used?**  
   A **RESTful API** is an API that adheres to the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), an architectural style designed to make web services simple, scalable, and stateless. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations and represent data in formats like JSON or XML. They are widely used because they are platform-independent, stateless, and cacheable, making them highly scalable and well-suited for web and mobile applications.

3. **Describe the main HTTP methods used in REST APIs and their purposes.**  
   - **GET**: Retrieves data from the server without altering it, commonly used to request resource details.
   - **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a new resource. It changes the serverâ€™s state by adding new information.
   - **PUT**: Updates or replaces an existing resource on the server.
   - **DELETE**: Removes a specified resource from the server.

4. **What is the purpose of a mock API, and how can it be useful in development?**  
   A **mock API** simulates the endpoints and data of a real API, allowing developers to test interactions and functionality without connecting to an actual backend. This is useful in early development when the backend may not yet be complete, enabling frontend developers to proceed with testing and interface development.

5. **Explain how you would set up a basic mock API for a product resource.**  
   To create a mock API for a product resource:
   - Use a tool like [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io) or [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
   - Define the resource structure with fields (e.g., `id`, `name`, `price`, `description`, `imageURL`).
   - Configure endpoints for CRUD operations: `/products` for GET (all), `/products/{id}` for GET (by ID), and POST, PUT, DELETE as needed.
   - Test endpoints with sample data to ensure proper functionality.

6. **What tools can be used to test APIs, and why are they necessary?**  
   - **Postman**: A popular API testing tool that allows sending requests, viewing responses, and saving configurations.
   - **Insomnia**: Similar to Postman, it offers a clean interface and powerful features for testing REST and GraphQL APIs.
   - **cURL**: Command-line tool that sends requests and is useful for automated or scripted testing.
   Testing tools are necessary to verify that endpoints work as expected, check error handling, and ensure data integrity.

7. **Describe the process of creating a new API endpoint using a mock API tool.**  
   - **Define the Endpoint**: Create a new endpoint path, such as `/products`.
   - **Specify Methods**: Assign HTTP methods to the endpoint (e.g., GET for retrieval, POST for creation).
   - **Add Fields and Data**: Configure resource fields (e.g., name, description) and add sample data.
   - **Test with Requests**: Use testing tools like Postman to send sample requests and validate responses.

8. **How can Postman be used to test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API requests?**  
   - **GET**: Enter the API URL, select GET, and click Send to retrieve data.
   - **POST**: Choose POST, enter the endpoint, and add JSON payload in the Body section to create a resource.
   - **PUT**: Select PUT, provide endpoint URL and updated data in the Body, and send request to modify a resource.
   - **DELETE**: Choose DELETE, enter the specific resource URL, and send the request to delete the resource.
   Postman allows verification of request responses, making it ideal for testing various HTTP methods.

9. **What is the importance of using structured data like JSON in API requests and responses?**  
   **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight, easy-to-read format for data exchange. It enables consistent, platform-independent communication and is widely supported by programming languages and tools. Structured data helps ensure that clients and servers interpret data correctly, making it easier to serialize, deserialize, and validate.

10. **Describe a scenario where caching an API response could improve performance.**  
    When a resource is frequently requested but rarely updated (e.g., product catalog data), caching the response improves performance by storing a copy of the data on the client or intermediary. This reduces server load and accelerates response times for repeated requests. Caching is particularly useful for read-heavy endpoints with low data variability.
