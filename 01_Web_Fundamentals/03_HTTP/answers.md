1. **What is HTTP, and what role does it play in web communication?**  
   **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is an application-layer protocol used to transfer hypertext documents, images, and other resources over the internet. It establishes the foundation for data exchange on the web, defining how clients (such as browsers) communicate with servers to request or send data. HTTP is a request-response protocol, meaning the client sends a request, and the server responds with the requested resource or relevant status information.

2. **What does it mean that HTTP is stateless, and why is it designed this way?**  
   HTTP is stateless, meaning that each request-response pair is independent of previous ones, and the server retains no memory of past interactions with the client. Statelessness allows for simplicity in the protocol and improves scalability, as each request is processed individually without relying on previous requests. To maintain session information (like user login state), mechanisms such as cookies or tokens are used, which are passed with each request to enable continuity.

3. **Differentiate between URI and URL in HTTP.**  
   - **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: A broader term that refers to a unique identifier for a resource on the internet. It can be a URL or a URN (Uniform Resource Name).
   - **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: A specific type of URI that provides the means to locate a resource by specifying its network location (e.g., http://www.example.com/page). All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.

4. **Describe the components of a URL in detail.**  
   - **Scheme**: Protocol used to access the resource, such as HTTP or HTTPS.
   - **Host**: The domain name or IP address of the server where the resource is hosted.
   - **Port** (optional): Network port to access the resource. HTTP defaults to 80, HTTPS to 443.
   - **Path**: Specifies the resource's location on the server, often representing folders or files.
   - **Query** (optional): Parameters appended to the URL, often used for searches or filtering (`?key=value`).
   - **Fragment** (optional): A specific part of the page indicated by `#` (e.g., `#section1`), for navigating within the resource.

5. **What are some common HTTP methods, and what are their purposes?**  
   - **GET**: Requests data from a server without modifying it.
   - **POST**: Sends data to the server to create a new resource or perform an action.
   - **PUT**: Updates or replaces a resource on the server.
   - **DELETE**: Removes a specified resource from the server.
   - **HEAD**: Similar to GET but only retrieves headers, not the body, useful for checking if a resource exists.
   - **OPTIONS**: Retrieves the HTTP methods supported by the server, allowing clients to understand the allowed actions.

6. **Explain the structure of an HTTP request. What are its key components?**  
   - **Request Line**: Contains the HTTP method, path, and protocol version (e.g., `GET /page HTTP/1.1`).
   - **Headers**: Key-value pairs with metadata about the request (e.g., `User-Agent`, `Content-Type`).
   - **Body** (optional): Data sent with the request, often in POST or PUT methods for form submissions, JSON, or file uploads.

7. **What is the structure of an HTTP response? Describe each component.**  
   - **Status Line**: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and a reason phrase describing the status (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).
   - **Headers**: Key-value pairs providing additional response metadata (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`).
   - **Body** (optional): Contains the requested resource data, such as HTML, JSON, or binary data.

8. **What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important? Give examples.**  
   HTTP status codes indicate the result of the client’s request and are categorized as follows:
   - **1xx (Informational)**: Indicates that the request is being processed (e.g., 100 Continue).
   - **2xx (Success)**: Confirms the request was successfully processed (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created).
   - **3xx (Redirection)**: Informs the client to use a different URL or action (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found).
   - **4xx (Client Error)**: Signals an issue with the request (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
   - **5xx (Server Error)**: Indicates a server-side error (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable).

9. **How does HTTPS differ from HTTP, and what advantages does it offer?**  
   HTTPS is HTTP with added security, using SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. HTTPS also requires a valid SSL/TLS certificate, which authenticates the server’s identity and establishes trust for users, especially on sensitive pages like login or payment screens.

10. **What measures can be implemented to improve HTTP security?**  
    - **Use HTTPS**: Encrypts data and verifies server identity.
    - **Authentication**: Requires users to authenticate, preventing unauthorized access.
    - **Secure Headers**: Implement headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options to mitigate attacks.
    - **Firewalls and IP Whitelisting**: Restricts server access to trusted IPs and filters malicious requests.
