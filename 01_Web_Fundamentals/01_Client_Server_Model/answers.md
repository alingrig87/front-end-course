1. **What is a Client in the Client-Server model?**  
   A **Client** is a machine, device, or application that initiates requests to access data or services provided by a server. In the context of a web-based application, a client is typically a web browser or mobile app. Clients are responsible for the presentation layer (what the user sees) and for generating requests for resources or information. The client interacts with the server through defined protocols, such as HTTP for web applications.

2. **Describe the role of a Server in the Client-Server model.**  
   A **Server** is a powerful, centralized machine or set of machines that provide resources, services, or data in response to client requests. It processes the client’s requests, performs necessary operations like accessing a database, and returns the data or service output to the client. Servers handle the business logic and data storage and are often designed to be accessible to multiple clients simultaneously. They often implement security, access control, and data validation as well.

3. **What are the main differences between a Client and a Server?**  
   - **Client**: Typically a user device or interface, initiating requests for data/services.
   - **Server**: Centralized machine providing data or services, often hosting the main business logic and database access.
   - **Processing Location**: Clients handle presentation and request creation, while servers manage data processing and resource distribution.
   - **Role in Network**: Clients request, while servers respond and manage resources.

4. **Can you give a few examples of applications that use the Client-Server model?**  
   - **Web Applications**: Web browsers as clients request pages from web servers.
   - **Email**: Clients (Outlook, Gmail) communicate with mail servers (SMTP/IMAP) to send and retrieve emails.
   - **Database Systems**: Applications interact with database servers to query, retrieve, and manipulate stored data.
   - **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: Clients use FTP to download/upload files from/to servers.

5. **What are some key advantages of using a Client-Server model in network architecture?**  
   - **Centralized Resource Management**: Servers manage resources centrally, making it easier to maintain, secure, and back up data.
   - **Scalability**: Server infrastructure can be expanded or improved to support increasing client requests.
   - **Enhanced Security**: Data and services are stored on centralized servers, simplifying access control and data integrity management.
   - **Reliability**: Through redundancy and backups, servers provide reliable service to clients.
   - **Interoperability**: Clients can be on different platforms or devices and still access the same server services.

6. **How does a web application work within the Client-Server model?**  
   In a web application, the client (browser or app) sends a request, usually an HTTP request, to the server for specific resources or actions. The server receives the request, processes it, retrieves or generates data (possibly querying a database), and returns the response. The client then processes and displays this information for the user. This model separates the user interface from the backend data processing, making the application more scalable and secure.

7. **What happens when a client sends a request to a server? Describe the basic steps.**  
   - **Connection Initiation**: The client establishes a connection, often TCP-based, to the server.
   - **Sending the Request**: The client sends a structured HTTP request specifying the method, path, headers, and potentially a body.
   - **Processing on Server**: The server interprets the request, applies logic, accesses a database if needed, and prepares the response.
   - **Response to Client**: The server sends back a structured HTTP response containing the requested data or an error status.
   - **Connection Termination**: Once the response is received, the connection may close or persist for further interactions.

8. **Explain the concept of “single point of failure” in the context of the Client-Server model.**  
   In the Client-Server model, the server is often the only source of data or services for all clients. If the server fails (due to hardware, software, or network issues), it results in a "single point of failure" where all connected clients lose access to resources or services. To mitigate this, redundancy and load balancing are typically implemented to ensure high availability.

9. **What are some disadvantages or limitations of the Client-Server model?**  
   - **Server Overload**: High client demand can overload the server, reducing performance or causing failure.
   - **Single Point of Failure**: Server unavailability affects all clients.
   - **Security Risks**: As the centralized data storage, servers are often targets for attacks.
   - **Scalability Constraints**: Scaling servers can be costly and technically complex.

10. **How does a server handle multiple requests from different clients simultaneously?**  
    - **Multi-threading**: Each request is handled by a separate thread, enabling concurrent processing.
    - **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking mechanisms are used so multiple requests can be processed in parallel.
    - **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple servers to manage traffic and avoid overload.
